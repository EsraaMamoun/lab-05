I did the functionality in server.js. I didn't copy the function, I wrote it but I didn't understand what I did and why I wrote it (maybe to run the website what we build on the server!?)!! also I don't know if I follow the requirement of the assignment, it's difficult to understand what the assignment need to do!!
